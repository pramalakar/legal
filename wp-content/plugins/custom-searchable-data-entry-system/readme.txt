== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I hide some of the data from user's search query? =

Very Easy! All you have to do is to edit the field that you want to hide and checkmark "Hide This Field From Search Query".

**Example**

For Example let's assume you have named your form "Clients" and you've put some fields to it like "Name", "Project", "Email". Now you've made some entries to this this form and suddenly you realized you want to hide the "Email" field from user's search query when they are searching for a particular client or a particular project. In this situation all you have to is to refer to the same form that you've made your entries through it. In this example you have to refer to "Clients" form which can be found under "Forms" menu. Then you edit the "Email" field and you checkmark the "Hide This Field From Search Query"; click Update and you're done. The Email information will not be shown on front-end search query anymore.
